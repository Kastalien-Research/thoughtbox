# Init Prompt

Alright Claude, I would like for you to consider everything in this project that is not actually Thoughtbox code or that doesn't relate to config or deployment or anything like that.

What I would like for you to do instead is to look at the builder scaffolding around Thoughtbox as well as the compound engineering workflow, which you have access to via a plugin.

In particular, pay attention to these folders and files:

- `@.claude/`
- `@.beads/`
- `@.github/`
- `@agentic-dev-team/agentic-dev-team-spec.md`
- `@agentops/`
- `@dgm-specs/`

I would like for you to engage in a long reasoning process. This reasoning process ideally will involve an agent team. What I want you to do is do a mixture of pure reasoning, code-based research, and research enabled by external tools such as Firecrawl and Exa.

What I'm trying to get at with everything that I've included, as well as the compound engineering plugin from Every, is I want us to have both a long-running development workflow as well as a codebase that each individually and between them promote very long-horizon tasks that converge on continual self-improvement and self-refinement.

I want you to consider the challenges that we would expect to find along the way. I want you to consider what's already in here that could be used across many runs to enable this sort of thing. I would like for you to, when you are done, produce a markdown spec, or more accurately probably a folder full of them, describing what we can do to take the vision that we already have here and fully realize it.

Something that I would like for you to do in the interest of maximizing our leverage here is I would like for you to, in between stages of this process, to call some tool to check what the time is. I want this to run for about 45 minutes to an hour, and I want you to just figure out things to do during that time that will make this series of specs, as well as a plan that you produce along with it to actually implement it, the very, very, very best. Be liberal with your use of tokens. Spend all of the money that you can through use of your MCP tools.

I think that we have all or most of the building blocks of something really, really, really great here. We've just got to bring it home.
