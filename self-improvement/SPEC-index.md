## Quick Summary

The repo contains a self-improvement loop runner, tiered evaluator, behavioral
contracts, and observability infrastructure. These are not wired into a persistent,
automated feedback loop. The specs in this folder define the exact gaps and the
required work to make improvement measurable and continuous.
