Full data model (9 types: AgentIdentity, Workspace, WorkspaceAgent, Problem, Comment, Proposal, Review, ConsensusMarker, Channel)\n2. Hub operations (20 operations across 6 categories: identity, workspaces, problems, proposals, consensus, channels)\n3. Channel mechanics — MCP Resources with subscription support, URI scheme: thoughtbox://hub/{workspace}/channels/{problem}\n4. Proxy specification — capability handshake, 4-cell capability matrix, in-process Tasks adapter\n5. Merge thought semantics — synthesis on main chain, branch preservation\n6. Progressive disclosure — 3 access stages\n7. Storage layout — JSON files alongside existing session storage\n8. Module structure — 9 source files + test suite\n9. MCP Tasks mapping — immediate vs task-eligible operations, state mapping\n10. Hypothesis validation plan\n11. Migration/compatibility guarantees\n12.
