  "prompt": "You're building an analytics dashboard for a SaaS product that needs to:\n- Display real-time metrics (updated every 1-5 seconds)\n- Show historical trends over 90 days\n- Support complex aggregations (counts, sums, averages, percentiles)\n- Handle 10,000+ events per second at peak\n- Provide sub-second query response times\n- Support 500+ concurrent dashboard users\n\nYou're evaluating three database options:\n\n**Option A: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB**\n- Familiar SQL interface\n- Strong consistency guarantees\n- Excellent for time-series data\n- Requires careful indexing and partitioning\n- Query performance degrades with complex aggregations at scale\n\n**Option B: ClickHouse**\n- Columnar storage, extremely fast for analytics\n- Handles billions of rows easily\n- Weak consistency (eventual consistency)\n- Less familiar query syntax\n- Limited UPDATE/DELETE support\n\n**Option C: Redis + PostgreSQL hybrid**\n- Redis for real-time data and hot aggregations\n- PostgreSQL for historical data\n- Most operationally complex\n- Requires data synchronization logic\n- Best of both worlds but higher maintenance\n\nWhich option would you choose and why? Analyze the trade-offs systematically and explain your recommendation.\n\nProvide a structured analysis with clear reasoning.",
