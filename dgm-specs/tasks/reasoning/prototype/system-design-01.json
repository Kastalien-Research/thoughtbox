  "prompt": "Design a client library for interacting with a third-party API that has strict rate limits:\n- 100 requests per minute per API key\n- 10 requests per second burst limit\n- 429 (Too Many Requests) responses include Retry-After header\n- API is critical for business operations and downtime is costly\n\nYour client library needs to handle:\n1. Multiple concurrent callers across different parts of the application\n2. Graceful handling of rate limit errors\n3. Automatic retry with backoff\n4. Visibility into rate limit status\n\nDescribe your architecture design at a high level. Focus on the key components and how they interact. Explain your design decisions.\n\nProvide a structured design with clear reasoning.",
