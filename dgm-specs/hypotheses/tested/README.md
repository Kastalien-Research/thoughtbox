# Tested Hypotheses

**Completed experiments with results.**

## Results Template

After evaluation, hypotheses move here with results appended:

```markdown
## Results
- **Outcome**: Accepted / Rejected / Inconclusive
- **Benchmark scores**: [before] → [after]
- **Cost**: Actual tokens/time consumed
- **Observations**: What we learned beyond pass/fail
- **Follow-up**: New hypotheses spawned, if any

## Integration
If accepted: PR link, commit hash, CLAUDE.md updates made.
If rejected: Why, and what this rules out for future attempts.
```
