# Letta Integration Specs (Deferred)

> **Archived**: 2026-01-21
> **Status**: Deferred - not part of current Thoughtbox work

These specs document future integration between Letta Code and Thoughtbox for cross-system DGM self-improvement. This work is deferred while we focus on Thoughtbox-only self-improvement (see `.specs/self-improvement-loop/`).

## Contents

- `dependency-graph.md` - DGM-001 to DGM-009 dependency analysis
- `inventory.md` - Full spec inventory with status
- `readiness-report.md` - Implementation readiness assessment
- `distbook-status.md` - Distbook evaluation environment status

## When to Revisit

Resume this work when:
1. Thoughtbox SIL is operational (SIL-000 through SIL-012 complete)
2. Letta Code workspace is ready for DGM integration
3. Cross-system MCP communication is needed

## Original Scope

The specs covered:
- DGM-001: MCP Client (Local Mode)
- DGM-002: Archive System
- DGM-003: Reflection Sessions
- DGM-004: Metrics Co-Evolution
- DGM-005: Bidirectional Sampling
- DGM-006: DGM Improvement Loop
- DGM-007: Test Generator
- DGM-008: CI/CD Safety
- DGM-009: Docker Automation
