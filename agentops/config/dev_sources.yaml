# Lab/company updates:
# Option A: RSS endpoints
# - OpenAI News page links an RSS endpoint at /news/rss.xml.  [oai_citation:0‡OpenAI](https://openai.com/news/)

# Option B: HTML listing sources (more brittle, but works when RSS isn't available)
# Anthropic newsroom is a good candidate for HTML-list parsing.  [oai_citation:1‡Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news)

# Selector Maintenance Guide:
# If a site stops returning signals:
# 1. Open the site in browser
# 2. Inspect a news/blog article element
# 3. Update container/title/link selectors to match current HTML
# 4. Set fallback_to_generic: true for safety
# 5. Test with: npm run agentops:daily -- --dry-run

# Notes:
# The web tool had trouble fetching some RSS XML directly, but that doesn’t mean your Node fetch will fail; it’s often user-agent/header related. For OpenAI, the site itself links the RSS endpoint.
