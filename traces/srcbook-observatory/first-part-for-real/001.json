Axes: (1) Execution modality (static→reactive→agentic→swarm), (2) Integration depth (isolated→observatory-connected→container-spawning→multi-system). Target: 100+ distinct behavior phenotypes across ~25 niches. Method: divergent exploration → constraint checking → synthesis. Tools avail: Firecrawl (web), Context7 (docs), container-use (sandboxed exec), Observatory (WS streaming). Starting w/ landscape mapping.",
