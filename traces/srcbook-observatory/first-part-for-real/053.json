Cross-cutting concerns: (1) Notebook serialization/hydration (.src.md) (2) State synchronization (Observatory WS) (3) Isolated execution (container-use) (4) Reasoning persistence (Thoughtbox sessions) (5) Tool orchestration (MCP). These 5 primitives combine to enable all phenotypes. Next: explore novel ARCHITECTURAL patterns that amplify capabilities.",
