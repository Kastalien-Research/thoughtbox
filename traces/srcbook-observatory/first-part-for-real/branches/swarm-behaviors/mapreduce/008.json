Reducer notebook synthesizes. Observable topology in Observatory. Use case: large codebase analysis, multi-doc research synthesis, parallel hypothesis testing. Key innovation: reasoning parallelism, not just compute parallelism. Each mapper uses Thoughtbox independently, reducer does meta-reasoning on outputs.",
