Each notebook = autonomous unit w/ (1) perception (inputs/events) (2) cognition (Thoughtbox reasoning) (3) action (code execution, tool calls). Swarm emerges when notebooks: share state via Observatory WS, coordinate via message passing, have complementary specializations. Phenotype A1: 'Research Swarm' - N notebooks each explore different aspects of topic, share findings via shared memory, synthesize collective knowledge.",
