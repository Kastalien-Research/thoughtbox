Notebooks leave 'pheromone traces' (annotations, links, weights) on shared knowledge graph. Other notebooks follow high-pheromone paths. No direct communication - coordination emerges from environment modification. Observable: knowledge graph evolving in Observatory. Use case: collaborative documentation, emergent ontology construction, distributed fact-checking.",
