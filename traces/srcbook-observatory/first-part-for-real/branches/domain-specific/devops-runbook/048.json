On incident: (1) Reads runbook steps (2) Executes each in container (3) Observes results (4) Makes decisions on conditional branches (5) Escalates when uncertain. Observable: execution progress, decision points, human override capability. Thoughtbox: reasons about which path to take, when to pause for human. Revolutionary: runbooks that actually run themselves with judgment.",
