Process: (1) Parses architecture (2) Thoughtbox applies STRIDE/attack trees (3) Generates threat scenarios (4) Branches on attack paths (5) Evaluates exploitability (6) Recommends mitigations. Observable: attack tree visualization, threat heatmap, risk matrix. Container: runs PoC exploits in sandbox (!!). Output: threat model doc + prioritized remediation. Revolutionary: automated threat modeling with AI attacker mindset.",
