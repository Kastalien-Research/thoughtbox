    "thought": "S56|H|S53|Architectural Pattern: 'Reactive Dataflow'. Notebooks as reactive graphs. Cells declare dependencies. Change in one cell → automatic re-execution of dependents. Observable: dependency graph, propagation path, stale indicators. Like Excel but for code+reasoning. Enables: (1) Live dashboards (2) Incremental computation (3) What-if analysis. Technical: build DAG from cell references, topological sort for execution order, dirty tracking.",
