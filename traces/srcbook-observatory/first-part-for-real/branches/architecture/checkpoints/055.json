    "thought": "S55|H|S53|Architectural Pattern: 'Reasoning Checkpoints'. Problem: long reasoning chains risk context overflow or failure. Solution: checkpoint Thoughtbox state to persistent storage. On failure: resume from checkpoint. Observable: checkpoint timeline, state diffs. Enables: (1) Resumable reasoning (2) Branching from historical states (3) Reasoning playback/replay. Technical: serialize Thoughtbox session to JSON, store in notebook metadata or external store. Like git for thoughts.",
