Draws on: (1) Srcbook's .src.md format (serializable) (2) Thoughtbox's reasoning (meta-cognition) (3) Observatory's visualization (introspection). Key insight: if notebooks are code + reasoning, then meta-notebooks can reason about reasoning. Opens: self-improvement, notebook synthesis, reasoning optimization.",
