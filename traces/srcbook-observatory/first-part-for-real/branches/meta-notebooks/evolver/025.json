Fitness: execution success, output quality, resource efficiency, code clarity. Selection: top performers breed. Mutation: cell reordering, dep changes, logic tweaks. Crossover: merge cells from different parents. Observable: fitness landscape, lineage tree, Pareto frontier. Key: notebooks as genotypes, behaviors as phenotypes. True artificial life in notebook space.",
