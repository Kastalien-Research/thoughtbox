When notebook execution fails: (1) Parses error + stack trace (2) Reads notebook source as data (3) Uses Thoughtbox to hypothesize root cause (4) Generates fix candidates (5) Tests fixes in container. Observable: hypothesis tree, fix attempts, success/failure. Key innovation: treating notebook-as-patient, reasoning about its structure. Recursive: can debug itself if meta-debugger fails.",
