Identifies: (1) Redundant reasoning loops (2) Missed branching opportunities (3) Premature convergence (4) Under-explored hypotheses. Generates: optimized reasoning templates, better prompts, pattern recommendations. Observable: reasoning topology analysis, optimization suggestions, before/after comparison. Self-improvement loop: optimizer improves own reasoning patterns. Connects to DGM/CycleQD evolution in memory system.",
