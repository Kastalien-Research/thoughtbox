Multiple AI notebooks compete on coding challenges. Each: reads problem, reasons w/ Thoughtbox, generates solution, runs in container. Scoring: correctness, efficiency, elegance. Observable: solutions side-by-side, reasoning comparison, skill progression. Human can: spectate, challenge winner, learn from strategies. Emergent: AI that explains its competitive coding strategies.",
