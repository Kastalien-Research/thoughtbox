Property: given spec, generate exhaustive test cases. Swarm notebooks: each explores different input space region. Containers: execute tests in parallel. Multi-system: test against multiple API versions. Synthesis: coverage report + discovered edge cases. Observable: test space coverage map, failure clusters, property violations. Emergent: test suite that improves itself.",
