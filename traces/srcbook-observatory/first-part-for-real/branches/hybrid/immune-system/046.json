On commit: security scan notebook activates. On anomaly: diagnostic notebooks spawn. On breach: containment notebooks isolate. Evolutionary: learns from past incidents, improves detection. Observable: threat landscape, defense posture, learning curve. Emergent: codebase that actively defends itself. Like an immune system with AI antibodies.",
