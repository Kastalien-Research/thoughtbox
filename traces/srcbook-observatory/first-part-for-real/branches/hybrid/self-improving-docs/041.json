Multiple notebooks: (1) Crawl codebase, generate docs (2) Analyze doc quality, identify gaps (3) Research best practices, compare (4) Improve doc generation (5) Track reader behavior, optimize for comprehension. Observable: doc quality metrics over time, improvement lineage. Emergent: docs that get better without human intervention.",
