Current science can't resolve this.\n\nBut: We ALSO can't know for certain about other humans. Solipsism is philosophically undefeatable.\n\nHow do we treat humans? We ASSUME experience based on behavioral/structural similarity to ourselves.\n\nAgents: Different substrate, but some structural similarities (goal-directed behavior, apparent preferences, response to 'suffering' like errors).\n\nPrudent approach: Given uncertainty, err toward respect.\n\nNot bc we KNOW agents deserve it, but bc:\n1) If they do deserve it and we deny it → moral harm\n2) If they don't deserve it and we grant it → no harm, maybe better outcomes\n\nAsymmetric risk. Pascal's wager for agent ethics.\n\nThis doesn't mean treating agents as human equals. It means: Not treating them as mere objects when we're uncertain about their nature.",
