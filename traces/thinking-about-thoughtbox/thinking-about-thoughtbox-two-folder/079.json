    "thought": "S79|Q|S78|AGENT SELF-AWARENESS OF CONFIGURATION:\n\nShould agent know its own tool configuration? Currently: implicit. Agent discovers capabilities through use or system prompt listing.\n\nArguments FOR explicit awareness:\n- Body awareness is fundamental to agency\n- Can't plan well w/o knowing capabilities\n- Prevents frustrating 'reaching for missing limb' moments\n- Enables meta-reasoning about own abilities\n\nArguments AGAINST:\n- Adds cognitive load\n- May cause unnecessary self-limitation\n- Human bodies don't come with manuals either\n- Discovery-through-use is natural\n\nResolution?: PROPRIOCEPTIVE awareness, not EXPLICIT knowledge.\n\nI shouldn't need to recite my tool list. I should FEEL what I can do. Like knowing I can reach the shelf w/o measuring my arm length.\n\nThis returns to proprioception theme. Tool awareness should be felt, not catalogued.",
