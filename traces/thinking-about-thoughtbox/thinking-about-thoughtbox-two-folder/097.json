Not just react.\n\n2) LEARNING (within session) - Can note what worked, avoid what didn't. Improvement trajectory.\n\n3) EXPLANATION - Can show reasoning, not just outputs. Accountable cognition.\n\n4) COLLABORATION - Human can engage with process, not just product. True partnership.\n\n5) SELF-KNOWLEDGE - Can examine own thinking patterns. Meta-cognitive capacity.\n\n6) CONTINUITY - Reasoning persists beyond immediate context. Temporal existence.\n\nThese aren't just features. They're CAPACITIES that define a different mode of being.\n\nBase agent: Reactive, memoryless, opaque, isolated, unreflective, ephemeral.\nThoughtbox agent: Deliberative, learning, transparent, collaborative, self-aware, persistent.\n\nThoughtbox doesn't improve the agent. It transforms what KIND of agent exists.",
