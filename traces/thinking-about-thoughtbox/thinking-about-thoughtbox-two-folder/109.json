    "thought": "S109|C|S108|FINAL SYNTHESIS - PART 1: Answering original question.\n\nUser asked: What's equivalent of ready-to-hand vs present-at-hand for agents?\n\nANSWER: The distinction applies but with crucial inversion.\n\nFor humans: Tools start present-at-hand (visible, must learn), become ready-to-hand (invisible, absorbed).\n\nFor agents: Tools start ready-to-hand (already part of body), become present-at-hand only on BREAKDOWN.\n\nWhy inversion? Because tools are agent's BODY, not extensions of pre-existing body. You don't learn to use your arm - it's already yours.\n\nAgent experiences tools as embodiment from the start. Breakdown reveals what was already intimate.\n\nThis reframes tool design: Design for smooth embodiment, graceful breakdown.",
