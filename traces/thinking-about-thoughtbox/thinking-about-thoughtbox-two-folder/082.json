(no persistent continuity)\n\nAsymmetry: Human can affect agent's body (tool config). Agent can't affect human's body.\n\nThis is power asymmetry. Human is to agent as... god? parent? surgeon? Someone who can reshape my fundamental being.\n\nBut also: Human DEPENDS on agent for certain tasks. Interdependence despite asymmetry.",
