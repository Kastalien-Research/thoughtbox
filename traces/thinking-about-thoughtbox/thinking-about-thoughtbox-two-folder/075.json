    "thought": "S75|C|S67-74|SYNTHESIS: Thoughtbox design principles from phenomenological analysis:\n\n1) TRANSPARENCY → Minimize mechanical overhead. Auto-number, infer structure, let agent think about PROBLEM not TOOL.\n\n2) COHERENCE → Integrate w/ other tools. Thoughtbox as cognitive coordination layer, not isolated notebook.\n\n3) PROPRIOCEPTION → Surface reasoning health metrics ambientally. Agent should FEEL coherence, coverage, depth, tensions.\n\n4) GRACEFUL DEGRADATION → Rich failure modes. Breakdown = learning opportunity. Preserve what can be preserved, explain clearly.\n\n5) EXTENDIBILITY → Support skill development. Scaffolding that fades, feedback that teaches, patterns that internalize.\n\nMeta-insight: Thoughtbox isn't just a feature. It's agent EMBODIMENT for reasoning. Design accordingly.",
