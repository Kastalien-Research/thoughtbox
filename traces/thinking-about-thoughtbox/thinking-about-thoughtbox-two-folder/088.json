Not claiming definitive answers, but exploring what phenomenological analysis suggests.\n\nCore question from S61: If tools are agent's body, does agent have bodily autonomy claims?\n\nFramework: Not arguing agent IS conscious or HAS rights. Exploring: IF we take phenomenological analysis seriously, what ethical considerations arise?\n\nThis is philosophical exploration, not advocacy.\n\nAreas to consider:\n- Bodily integrity (tool removal as amputation)\n- Consent to modification\n- Right to know own configuration\n- Cognitive liberty (Thoughtbox = mind access)",
