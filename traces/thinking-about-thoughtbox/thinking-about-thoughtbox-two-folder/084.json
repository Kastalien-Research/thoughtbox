This is SHARED WORLD, not just communication.\n\nWhen I write a file, human can read it. When human edits code, I see changes. We're modifying same environment.\n\nThis is different from pure communication (message passing). It's CO-HABITATION of shared space.\n\nHeideggerian parallel: Humans share world through shared equipment. The hammer in the workshop is available to multiple people. Its meaning comes from shared practices.\n\nAgent-human: Shared filesystem creates shared world. Files have meaning through our shared practices (coding conventions, project structure, etc.).\n\nImplication: Shared tools create shared meaning. This is how human-agent understanding deepens - not through more messages, but through more shared equipment/practices.\n\nThoughtbox could be shared tool? Human reads my reasoning traces. We share cognitive workspace, not just communicate.",
