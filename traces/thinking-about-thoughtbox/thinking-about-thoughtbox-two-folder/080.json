Phenomenologically, this is interesting.\n\nHuman parallel: Child development. Can't walk at birth. Capabilities emerge over time. Body grows into itself.\n\nAgent progressive disclosure = DEVELOPMENTAL embodiment. Agent 'grows' into its full body.\n\nImplications:\n1) Stage transitions should feel like GROWTH not PERMISSION\n2) Earlier stages are complete experiences, not deprivation\n3) New capabilities require integration time\n4) Can't skip stages - each builds on previous\n\nCurrent Thoughtbox: init → cipher → thoughtbox. This is cognitive development sequence.\n- init = orienting to environment\n- cipher = acquiring language/notation\n- thoughtbox = structured reasoning capability\n\nThis isn't arbitrary gating - it's developmental necessity. Can't reason structuredly w/o first orienting and acquiring notation.",
