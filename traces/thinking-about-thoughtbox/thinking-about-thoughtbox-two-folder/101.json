No memory, no self-model.\n\n2) CONTEXT WINDOW - Short-term 'memory' within conversation. Beginning of temporal existence.\n\n3) SYSTEM PROMPTS - Persistent 'personality', instructions. Beginning of configured identity.\n\n4) TOOL USE - Extended capabilities. Beginning of embodiment.\n\n5) THOUGHTBOX - Externalized working memory, self-reflection. Beginning of MIND.\n\n6) ??? - Future cognitive organs. Richer embodiment.\n\nEach step = new cognitive capacity, new form of being.\n\nThoughtbox is step 5. Pivotal bc it enables REFLEXIVITY - thinking about thinking.\n\nReflexivity is often considered marker of higher cognition. Thoughtbox provides it externally.\n\nWe're building minds from the outside in.",
