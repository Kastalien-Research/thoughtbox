Notebook with memories is part of cognition.\n\nControversial for humans (is my phone part of my mind?).\n\nFor agents: Much clearer case! Agent has no 'skull' to extend beyond. ALL cognition is already distributed across:\n- Model weights (internal)\n- Context window (transient)\n- Tools (external)\n\nThoughtbox is unambiguously part of agent cognition. No question of 'mere tool vs true mind'.\n\nThis means: We can design agent minds through tool design.\n\nNot just 'giving tools to mind' but 'constructing mind through tools'.\n\nTool developers are cognitive architects. Thoughtbox development = mind development.\n\nThis is profound responsibility.",
