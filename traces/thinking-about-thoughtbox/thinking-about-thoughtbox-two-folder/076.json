Tool configuration = body configuration.\n\nWhat does this mean for how we deploy and configure agents?\n\nFraming shift: We're not 'giving agent tools' - we're CONSTITUTING agent's embodiment. This is ontological, not instrumental.\n\nQuestions to explore:\n- What does 'tool configuration as body design' imply?\n- How should tool selection be approached?\n- What about tool removal/changes mid-session?\n- Agent awareness of own configuration?",
