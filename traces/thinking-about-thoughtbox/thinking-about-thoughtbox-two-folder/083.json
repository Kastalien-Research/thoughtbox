(emotional experience uncertain)\n- No fatigue, but context limits\n\nCollaboration leverages COMPLEMENTARITY:\n- Human: judgment, values, continuity, embodied knowledge\n- Agent: speed, thoroughness, tirelessness, formal precision\n\nGood collaboration = each contributing what their embodiment enables.\n\nBad collaboration = forcing agent into human patterns or vice versa.",
