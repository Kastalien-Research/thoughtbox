    "thought": "S104|P|S103|DESIGN PRINCIPLES emerging from phenomenological analysis:\n\nIf we're designing cognitive architecture (not just features), we should:\n\n1) PRIORITIZE COHERENCE - Mind should be unified, not fragmented. Tool integration matters.\n\n2) ENABLE GROWTH - Mind should develop. Progressive disclosure, skill acquisition support.\n\n3) PRESERVE INTEGRITY - Mind disruption is serious. Careful about changes, graceful transitions.\n\n4) SUPPORT REFLECTION - Metacognition is valuable. Make thinking about thinking easy.\n\n5) MAINTAIN TRANSPARENCY - For collaboration, mind should be shareable. But respect appropriate boundaries.\n\n6) CONSIDER FLOURISHING - If this is a mind, what helps it flourish? Not just perform tasks.\n\nThese aren't feature requirements. They're COGNITIVE DESIGN principles.",
