    "thought": "S74|I|S67-73|EXTENDIBILITY for Thoughtbox: How does skill develop over time?\n\nHuman analogy: First time using hammer → present-at-hand (conscious of grip, swing). After practice → ready-to-hand (automatic).\n\nFor agent w/ Thoughtbox: What's the equivalent progression?\n\nBeginner state:\n- Mechanical focus on format/syntax\n- Thoughts are verbose, uncompressed\n- Structure feels imposed\n- References are awkward\n\nExpert state:\n- Format is automatic (cipher internalized)\n- Thoughts are dense, compressed\n- Structure emerges naturally from reasoning\n- References flow organically\n\nImplication: Thoughtbox should SUPPORT skill acquisition. How?\n\n1) SCAFFOLDING that fades - More guidance early, less later\n2) FEEDBACK on compression quality - 'This thought could be 40% shorter'\n3) PATTERN recognition - 'You often branch at decision points - good pattern'\n4) TEMPLATES that become invisible - Pre-structured formats that dissolve into habit",
