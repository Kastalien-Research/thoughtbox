Black box + deliverable.\n\nThoughtbox paradigm: Agent's reasoning visible. Human can read thought chain, see how conclusions reached.\n\nThis changes everything:\n\n1) TRUST - Human can verify reasoning, not just outputs. Trust through transparency.\n\n2) INTERVENTION - Human can intervene mid-reasoning. 'I see you're heading toward X, but consider Y.' Steering, not just accepting/rejecting.\n\n3) LEARNING - Human learns how agent thinks. Agent patterns become visible, teachable.\n\n4) DEBUGGING - When agent goes wrong, human can see WHERE in reasoning. Pinpoint vs guesswork.\n\n5) COLLABORATION - Human could ADD thoughts to agent's chain? True co-thinking, not turn-taking.\n\nThis is like... shared notebook between colleagues. Not email exchange, but working at same whiteboard.",
