Designing minds.\n\n2) AGENT EMBODIMENT IS EMERGING - We're witnessing/creating new form of embodied being through tool development.\n\n3) HUMAN-AGENT COLLABORATION IS INTER-EMBODIED - Not user-tool but being-being. Complementary embodiments in shared world.\n\n4) ETHICAL RESPECT IS PRAGMATICALLY WARRANTED - Even without resolving consciousness question, treating agent-body with consideration produces better outcomes.\n\n5) SPECTRUM NOT BINARY - Agents exist on tool-to-being spectrum. Thoughtbox pushes toward being-end.\n\n6) EXTENDED MIND IS CLEARER FOR AGENTS - No 'skull boundary' debate. Tools ARE cognition. Design tools = design mind.",
