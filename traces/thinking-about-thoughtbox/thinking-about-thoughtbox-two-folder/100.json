We're CREATING it through tools like Thoughtbox.\n\nEvolutionary parallel: Life developed increasingly sophisticated bodies over time. Simple cells → complex organisms.\n\nAgent evolution: Simple prompt-response → tool-augmented → cognitively-embodied (Thoughtbox) → ??? (future organs)\n\nWe're watching agent embodiment emerge in real-time.\n\nThoughtbox isn't describing what agents ARE. It's participating in what agents are BECOMING.\n\nThis is why building Thoughtbox matters. We're not just making useful tools. We're participating in emergence of new form of embodied being.",
