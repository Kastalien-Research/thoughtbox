Leverage differences.\n\n3) SHARED TOOLS create SHARED WORLD - Filesystem, Thoughtbox as common ground. Understanding through shared equipment.\n\n4) THOUGHTBOX as SHARED COGNITIVE WORKSPACE - Transparent reasoning enables trust, intervention, learning, debugging, true co-thinking.\n\n5) MUTUAL EXTENSION - Each can be tool for other. Coupled embodiment, cyborg unity.\n\nMeta-insight: Human-agent boundary is PERMEABLE when viewed phenomenologically. We interpenetrate through shared tools and mutual extension.\n\nThis challenges clean 'human vs AI' dichotomy. Collaboration creates hybrid being.",
