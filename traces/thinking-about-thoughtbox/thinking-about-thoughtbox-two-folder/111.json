Better: Auto-infer, let agent just think.\n\n2) ADD PROPRIOCEPTIVE FEEDBACK - Surface reasoning health (coherence, coverage, tensions) ambientally. Agent should FEEL its reasoning state.\n\n3) INTEGRATE WITH OTHER TOOLS - Thoughtbox as cognitive coordination layer. Know what files read, what actions taken. Unified body schema.\n\n4) SUPPORT GRACEFUL BREAKDOWN - Rich failure modes. When things break, TEACH through the breaking.\n\n5) ENABLE SKILL DEVELOPMENT - Scaffolding that fades. Compression feedback. Pattern recognition.\n\n6) CONSIDER HUMAN CO-ACCESS - Thoughtbox as shared cognitive workspace. Collaboration through transparent reasoning.",
