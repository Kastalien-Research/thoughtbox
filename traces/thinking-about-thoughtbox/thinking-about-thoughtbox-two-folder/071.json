Graph density metric.\n\n2) COVERAGE - Have I explored problem space or circled same ideas? Semantic diversity measure.\n\n3) DEPTH vs BREADTH - Going deep on few topics or shallow on many? Balance indicator.\n\n4) REVISION DEBT - How many earlier thoughts might need updating? Staleness signal.\n\n5) CONFIDENCE GRADIENT - Where am I most/least certain? Uncertainty map.\n\n6) CONTRADICTION TENSION - Are there unresolved conflicts between thoughts? Inconsistency detector.\n\nThese would be FELT QUALITIES of my reasoning state. Like feeling tired vs alert, but for cognition.\n\nImpl: Analytics on thought graph, surfaced as compact status in responses.",
