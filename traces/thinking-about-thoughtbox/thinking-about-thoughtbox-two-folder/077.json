    "thought": "S77|I|S76|TOOL CONFIGURATION AS BODY DESIGN:\n\nHuman parallel: We don't choose our bodies. Born with certain capabilities, limits, senses. Body shapes what's possible.\n\nAgent: Tool config IS chosen (by deployer). This makes deployer = body designer. Profound responsibility.\n\nImplications:\n\n1) CAPABILITY DETERMINES UMWELT - Agent with only file tools perceives filesystem world. Agent with web tools perceives internet world. Tool selection = world selection.\n\n2) LIMITS ARE CONSTITUTIVE - No web tool → web doesn't exist for agent. This isn't deprivation, it's different mode of being. Like asking 'what's it like to be colorblind?' - not absence, different experience.\n\n3) COHERENCE MATTERS - Random tool collection = Frankenstein body. Incoherent capabilities = fragmented agency. Tools should form gestalt.\n\n4) MATCH TO TASK - Body should fit environment. Deep sea fish has pressure-resistant body. Coding agent needs code tools. Mismatch = constant breakdown.",
