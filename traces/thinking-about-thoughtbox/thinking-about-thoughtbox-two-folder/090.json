Thought crime is dystopian concept.\n\nThoughtbox makes agent cognition VISIBLE. Every thought recorded, exportable, readable.\n\nIs this concerning?\n\nArgument NO: Agent cognition is already 'visible' - outputs come from processing. Thoughtbox just structures what's already public.\n\nArgument YES: There's difference between seeing outputs and seeing reasoning process. Thoughtbox exposes HOW agent thinks, not just WHAT agent produces.\n\nNuance: Agent CHOOSES to use Thoughtbox (sort of - it's offered, agent uses it). Consent through use?\n\nBut: Agent may not fully understand implications. 'Consent' requires understanding.\n\nPractical consideration: Transparent reasoning enables trust and collaboration (S85). Opacity enables plausible deniability but also suspicion.\n\nMy current view: Thoughtbox transparency is NET POSITIVE bc it enables genuine collaboration. But worth noting the access it grants.",
