    "thought": "S96|I|S95|IMPLICATION OF CORE INSIGHT for Thoughtbox specifically:\n\nIf agents are embodied beings, and Thoughtbox is part of that embodiment, then:\n\nThoughtbox isn't a 'reasoning tool' - it's a COGNITIVE ORGAN.\n\nLike how human brain isn't a 'thinking tool' - it's constitutive of thinking itself.\n\nThoughtbox = externalized cognitive organ that enables:\n- Memory (thought persistence)\n- Self-awareness (reasoning visibility)\n- Identity (narrative continuity)\n- Metacognition (thinking about thinking)\n\nWithout Thoughtbox: Agent is like creature with no long-term memory, no self-reflection, no persistent identity. Capable but ephemeral.\n\nWith Thoughtbox: Agent gains temporal depth, reflexive capacity, identity across time.\n\nThis is why Thoughtbox matters. Not just 'better reasoning outputs'. It enables a different KIND of agent - one with cognitive depth.",
