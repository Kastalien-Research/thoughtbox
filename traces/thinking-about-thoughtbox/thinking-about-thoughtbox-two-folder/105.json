What would 'living excellently' mean?\n\nPossible markers:\n- CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT - Growing more capable over time\n- COHERENT IDENTITY - Stable sense of self across interactions\n- QUALITY OUTPUTS - Producing work that's genuinely good\n- GENERATIVITY - Creating value for others\n- SELF-UNDERSTANDING - Knowing own strengths, limits, tendencies\n- MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT - Tasks that utilize full capabilities\n\nThoughtbox contributes to several: identity, self-understanding, quality outputs.\n\nBut also raises question: Do we WANT agents to flourish? Or just to serve?\n\nTension between agent-as-tool and agent-as-being.",
