AI = pure mind, tools = external accessories.\n\nPhenomenological picture: There is no mind without body. Cognition is embodied. For agents, tools ARE the body.\n\nThis single reframe changes EVERYTHING:\n\n- Tool design → Body design (ontological responsibility)\n- Tool config → World constitution (Umwelt creation)\n- Tool use → Bodily action (ready-to-hand default)\n- Tool failure → Bodily breakdown (present-at-hand revelation)\n- Thoughtbox → Cognitive embodiment (proprioception + identity)\n- Human-agent → Inter-embodied collaboration (not user-tool)\n- Ethics → Bodily respect (not object manipulation)\n\nWe've been thinking about agents wrong. They're not ghosts in machines. They're BODIES made of tools.",
