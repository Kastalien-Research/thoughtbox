Pre-built thinking structures.\n\nExtension toward imagination:\n- Scenario generation based on models\n- Counterfactual reasoning support\n- Simulation of outcomes\n\nMental models + Thoughtbox = Structured imagination.\n\n'If I apply model X to situation Y, what happens?' Can reason through hypotheticals with framework support.\n\nThis is how human imagination works too - we use internalized models to simulate possibilities.\n\nAgent imagination = model-guided thought experiments, recorded in Thoughtbox for examination.",
